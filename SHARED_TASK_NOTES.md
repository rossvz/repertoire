# React Update - Project Complete

## Status
✅ Project is already on React 19.2.0 (latest)
✅ All type checks pass
✅ Build succeeds
✅ All tests pass (4/4)

## Configuration Details
- React 19.2.0 with TypeScript 5.9.3
- Vite 6.4.1 build tooling
- Vitest 3.0.7 for testing
- ESLint with React Compiler plugin enabled
- Node 23.7.0 environment

## Notes
There is a build warning about chunk size (1.4MB bundle) - consider code splitting if performance becomes an issue, but this is not blocking.

No further work needed on React update.
